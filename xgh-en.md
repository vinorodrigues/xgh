## Manifesto

### 1. If you think, it's not XGH.

 In XGH you don't think, you do the first thing that comes to your mind. There's not a  second option as the first one is faster.

### 2. There are 3 ways of solving a problem: the right way, the wrong way and the XGH way which is the same as the wrong way, just but faster.

XGH is faster than any software development process you know (see Axiom 14).

### 3. You'll always need to do more and more XGH.

For every problem solved using XGH, 7 more are created. But they can all be solved using XGH. Therefore XGH tends to the infinite.

### 4. XGH is completely reactive.

Errors only exist when they appear.

### 5. In XGH anything goes, just don't give your ass away.

Did it solve the problem? Did it compile? Then commit and that's it.

### 6. Always commit before updating.

If it goes to shit, then your part will always be correct... and your colleagues can go get fucked.

### 7. XGH doesn't have deadlines.

Deadlines given to you by your clients are merely details. You will ALWAYS be able to implement EVERYTHING in the time needed (even if that implies accessing the DB through a crazy script).

### 8. Be ready to jump off when the boat starts sinking... or place blame on someone or something.

For those using XGH, someday the boat will sink. The more time passes, the more the system becomes a monster. For the day the house comes down, it's best that you have your résumé registered with APInfo, or have something to blame.

### 9. Be authentic. XGH does not respect standards.

Write code as you wish, and if it solves the problem then commit and that's it.

### 10. There no refactoring, just rework.

If it turns to shit, then redo a quick XGH that solves the problem. The day that rework involves rewriting the entire application, then jump ship as the ship will sink. (See Axiom 8)

### 11. XGH is totally anarchic.

The role of a project manager is completely disposable. There is no owner, and everyone can do whatever they want when problems and requirements arise (See Axiom 4).

### 12. Always believe in promises of improvement.

Inserting TODO's in the code as a promise of improvement helps the XGH developer not to feel remorse or guilt for the mess they've made. Of course, refactoring will never be done (see Axiom 10).

### 13. XGH is absolute, it is not tied to relative things.

Deliverables and cost are absolute, quality is completely relative. Never think about quality, but rather about the shortest time it will take for a solution to be implemented. In fact... don't think, just do!

### 14. XGH is timeless.

Scrum, XP... they’re all fads. XGH doesn’t follow the latest fads, that’s for [~~*REDACTED*~~]. XGH has always, and will always, be used by those who despise quality.

### 15. XGH isn't always WOP (Workaround-Oriented programming).

Many POG's require very high level reasoning, XGH does not reason (see Axiom 1).

### 16. Don't try to swim against the tide.

If your colleagues use XGH to program and you're a wimp who likes to do things right, then forget it! For every Design Pattern you use correctly, your coworkers will generate 10 times more bad code using XGH.

### 17. XGH is not dangerous until some order is created.

This axiom is very complex, but it suggests that a project using XGH is amongst chaos. Don't try to bring order to XGH (See Axiom 16), it is useless and you will be throwing precious time into the trash. This will cause the project to sink even faster (See Axiom 8). Do not try to manage XGH, it is self-sufficient (See Axiom 11), just like chaos.

### 18. XGH is your brother, but it is vengeful.

As long as you want it, XGH will always be on your side. But be careful, don't abandon it. If you start a system using XGH and abandon it to use a trendy methodology, you're screwed. XGH doesn't allow refactoring (see Axiom 10), and your new system full of frills will collapse. And at that point, only XGH can save you.

### 19. If it works, don't touch it.

Never change, much less question, working code. That's a waste of time, especially since refactoring doesn't exist (See Axiom 10). Time is the gear that moves XGH and quality is a negligible detail.

### 20. Testing is for wimps.

If you've got your hands on an XGH system, you better know what you're doing. And if you know what you're doing, why test? Testing is a waste of time, if the code compiles, that's enough.

### 21. Get used to the feeling of imminent failure.

Failure and success always go hand in hand, and XGH is no different. People tend to think that the chances of a project failing using XGH are always greater than the chances of it being successful. But success and failure are a matter of perspective. Did the project fail, but you learned something? Then for you it was a success!

### 22. The problem is only yours when your name is in the source code.

Never touch source code whose author is not you. If a team member dies or becomes ill for a long time, then the ship will sink! In that case, use Axiom 8.
